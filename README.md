<h1>Responsive Web Design: Images and Sliders</h1>

<p>In this repository there are several examples of how to use responsive images on websites. These are from the <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/responsive-web-design-images-sliders">PluralSight Course: Hands-on Responsive Web Design 2: Responsive Images and Sliders</a>. For each page, you can play around with expanding and shrinking the screen size to watch the responsiveness between small, medium, and large screen sizes and see how the images change.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The best way to view these examples is to either clone the repository or download the files and open the files on your local machine. The GitHub Previewer is not fully functioning and you may come across a few errors. Also, to better view the changes in the images, FireFox is the best browser because it will rapidly switch between different-sized images, where Chrome will take the largest image and only display that image until you empty your cache and do a hard reload.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/Responsive_Design_Images/blob/master/Art_Direction/index.html">first example</a> shows how to use Art Direction. You can see how this works with the first image. When viewed on a small screen, you see mostly the person in the ruins, then on medium screen you can see more of the ruins, and finally on large screens you can see all of the ruins. The next two images of the Temple Mount show to properly employ Art Direction with the Picture element versus the Figure element. You can see the second image does not properly respond when setup in a figure tag, as it will not take into account pixel density for a device, whereas if you use the picture tag, it will properly go through the srcset of images, and you can also set it up to use media queries to ensure the image you want displayed at a certain size will be displayed. You may not see this in the previewer, but if you serve this on your local machine you will see how the third image has a 2x on the image when viewed in a small window and the second image has a 1x, showing the difference in pixel density.</p>
